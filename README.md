Hello there! I'm Sunil Kartikey ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I started my journey as a core C++ developer and embraced Go five years ago. Since then, Go has been my go-to language. I also had the opportunity to dive into Rust while working with Influxdata, finding its capabilities quite powerful.
ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm delving into advanced Go features and adopting best practices in infrastructure management. My exploration extends to containerization technologies, and I'm committed to enhancing my skills in cloud-native development.
ðŸ¤” Staying updated on the latest trends and best practices in Go development is a priority for me. I'm always eager to learn from the community and welcome any insights that can enrich my knowledge.
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about Go development, C++ programming, or anything related to technology and software development. I'm here to share my knowledge and engage in insightful conversations.
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
âš¡ Fun fact: Outside the realm of coding, I enjoy discovering new hiking trails and experimenting with cooking exotic cuisines. I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to broaden my horizons beyond the coding world.
